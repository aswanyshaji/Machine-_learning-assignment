## Introduction
The Seq2Seq model is a cornerstone of natural language processing, enabling tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and conversational AI. In this project, we demonstrate how to build a Seq2Seq model to translate English sentences into French 
using an encoder-decoder framework. By working through the notebook and tutorial, you will gain hands-on experience in implementing and understanding this cutting-edge technology.
## Key Steps in the Project
### 1. Dataset Preparation
We use an English-French dataset containing over 100,000 sentence pairs.
A subset of 10,000 sentences is used to ensure the implementation is efficient and runnable on systems with limited resources.
The dataset is cleaned, tokenized, and padded to make it ready for the Seq2Seq model.
### 2. Seq2Seq Model Architecture
The Seq2Seq model consists of:
Encoder: Processes the input sentence and summarizes it into a context vector.
Decoder: Takes the context vector and generates the translated output sentence.
LSTMs are used in both the encoder and decoder to handle sequential dependencies effectively.
### 3. Training the Model
The model is trained using padded sequences.
A portion of the data is set aside for validation to monitor generalization.
Training metrics, including loss and accuracy, are visualized over multiple epochs.
### 4. Inference
The trained model translates new English sentences into French.
Predictions are compared with actual translations to assess performance.
#  Results
The model demonstrates steady improvement in accuracy and a reduction in loss, as visualized in the training graphs. Although trained on a smaller dataset, the model shows the potential to generalize well. Adding more data or enhancing the architecture could further improve the results.
# Requirements
To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:
* Python 3.x 
* TensorFlow
* NumPy
